      <p>I find intense joy in traveling, experiencing new cultures and learning. Some of the main reasons I am pursuing a career in software engineering is because; by the end of my course I want to:
        <ul>
          <li>Have learned all that I can so I can offer the world of fellow engineers a hand</li>
          <li>Find a job that allows me to work remotely while ensuring financial stability</li>
         <li> Be able to travel more often</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Below is how I plan to acheive these goals:
          <ol>
            <li>Finish my Thinkful program</li>
            <li>Apply for entry level software engineering jobs</li>
            <li>Gain experience in the field and find a specialization I'm passionate about</li>
            <li>Make my dreams come true!</li>
          </ol>

    <h2 class="text-center body-header">A Bit More About Me</h2>
    <p>All of that being said, what truly drives me in life is simply being alive. The love you get and receive from your friends and family, the joy you feel when your favorite sports team wins a game- or the anger you feel when they lose. The taste of a delicous, overly greasy slice of pizza after a long day when your swore you were going to eat better. All of the little things that make humans, humans, that's what ultimately drives me in life and I find serentiy in the chaos of it all.</p>
